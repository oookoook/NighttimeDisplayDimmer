Are you a software developer, researcher, novelist, copywriter, or do you jsut work on our computer at night often? Chances are you battle eye strain caused by too bright displays.

Windows 10 and 11 offer a great feature that helps your eyes called [Night mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-your-display-for-night-time-in-windows-18fe903a-e0a1-8326-4c68-fd23d7aaf136). The Night mode reduces the amout of blue light emitted by the displays.

However, this app has a major drawback: it does not change display brightness. In many environments you need bright display during the day. But dimming the display for the night si too cumbersome using the display controls or external apps and you have to constantly adjust the settings, basically two times each day.

The *Sunset Dimmer* takes this responsiblity from you. Set up the desired brightness levels once and the app will take care of the rest. It will automatically dim your displays when sunset comes and increases the brightness back when you start woring in the morning.

Get the app from windows store, your eys will thank you!
